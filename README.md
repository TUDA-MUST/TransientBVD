**TransientBVD** is a Python library for analyzing and optimizing the transient response of ultrasound transducers (or other resonant systems) modeled by the Butterworth-Van Dyke (BVD) equivalent circuit. It implements advanced methods for both open-circuit (resistive damping) and closed-circuit (voltage overboost) strategies, significantly reducing transient response times.

## Features

- **Open-circuit damping**: Quickly compute an optimal parallel resistor \(R_p\) to minimize open-circuit transient response times.
- **Closed-circuit overboost**: Determine switching strategies (e.g. voltage amplitude changes) to reduce closed-circuit transient response times.
- **Comprehensive analysis**: Includes handy methods like `print_open_potential` and `print_closed_potential` for quick insights.
- **Transducer utility**: Load already measured example transducers or define your own BVD parameters.
- **Integration**: Based on Python (NumPy, SciPy, Sympy) for symbolic and numeric calculations.
