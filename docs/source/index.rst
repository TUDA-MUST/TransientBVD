TransientBVD — Transient Response Analysis
============================================

**TransientBVD** is a Python library for analyzing and optimizing the transient
response of ultrasound transducers (or other resonant systems) modeled by the
Butterworth-Van Dyke (BVD) equivalent circuit. It implements advanced methods
for both deactivation (resistive damping) and activation (voltage overboost)
strategies, significantly reducing transient response times.

This library is developed at the
`Measurement and Sensor Technology Group, TU Darmstadt <https://www.etit.tu-darmstadt.de/must/home_must/index.en.jsp>`_
to support our ongoing research in rapid transient control for ultrasound transducers.
You can find the source code on our lab's GitHub:
`TUDA-MUST <https://github.com/TUDA-MUST/TransientBVD>`_.
